# Project Title

QuietQueue: Smart Appointment & Line Management for Small Venues

# What and Why?

Small businesses often rely on sign-up sheets, first-come-first-serve lines, or phone calls for handling queues. This wastes time, frustrates customers, and causes these businesses to lose out on revenue when people leave due to long waits.

QuietQueue is a lightweight, mobile-friendly system that lets people join a virtual line remotely, get real-time wait updates, and receive a notification when it’s almost their turn. This helps businesses manage their flow more efficiently.

This solves a real gap: big chains have advanced systems, but smaller venues don’t have affordable, easy-to-use queue management tools.

# For Whom?

Users could include customers at small venues, such as students waiting at campus offices, or people lining up for barbershops, small restaurants, or local services.

Additionally, they could also include business owners who want to reduce chaos and manage appointments or queues without extra staffing. Examples include local barbershops, popular food trucks, etc.

# How?

From the customer side:

1. Open the app for the venue.

2. Tap “Join Queue” and get an estimated wait time.

3. Receive a text or notification when they’re 3-5 people away.

4. Show up just in time, instead of waiting physically.

From the business side:

1. Open the business dashboard and manage the active queue.

2. Check people in, move people up, or pause the line.

3. Send quick broadcast updates (e.g., “Closed early today”).

# Scope

This project is perfectly scoped for a semester. The targeted features will be user sign-up, join/leave queue, notifications, and the business dashboard. These goals are reasonably challenging for a group of 4-6 programmers to work towards in one semester.

However, in the case that the project is easier than expected, additional goals could include appointment scheduling, analytics such as average wait times, or QR code check-in.
